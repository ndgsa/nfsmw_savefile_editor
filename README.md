# Need for Speed: Most Wanted SaveFile Editor written in python

I found some old article that contains some hex code. So i write this script that used to manage hex codes.

What script can do:
- Read save file, backup it as `<filename>`.bak1
- Print data about cars, tunning slots, carrer slots, bonus markers
- Add Car to Shop, Career Garage
- Change Car Category (stok, shop, carrer)
- Change Tunning Slot of Career Cars or My Cars
- Remove Tunning Slot
- Set Money
- Set Heat Level
- Set Bounty
- Set all Markers to 3
- On Exit! It Fix SaveFile Checksum


## How to use

> Warning! This script can broke your save file, so before you use it, please make a backup of original file.

> Warning! I dont know how it will work with any car mod. 
    
```sh
python3 NFSMW-savefile-editor.py <your savefile>
```
